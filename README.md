# Meaning-of-life

Too busy to think about what life is all about?
Are you busy living your life? Perhaps you are busy at work or busy to fulfill your family needs. In the hustle and bustle of everyday life we ​​easily forget to think about the things that are really important. Why do we actually live? Do you have a purpose in life? What will happen after death?

Do not wait!
It is good to consider these questions at least once in your life. In a short while you are old or you may not get that chance. Can you look back on your life with satisfaction? Or are there things you regret. Are there any choices in life that you would have taken differently if you could do it over?

Does my life make sense?
You may think that life is of little use and that we should make the best out of it. Or do you think war are created with purpose?
